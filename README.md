This acts as a web-based CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) to allow
multiple caregivers to remotely view a patient's glucose data in
real time.  The server reads a MongoDB which is intended to be data
from a physical CGM, where it sends new SGV (sensor glucose values) as
the data becomes available.  The data is then displayed graphically
and blood glucose values are predicted 0.5 hours ahead using an
autoregressive second order model.  Alarms are generated for high and
low values, which can be cleared by any watcher of the data.

# Install

## Supported configurations:

If you plan to use Nightscout, we recommend using [Heroku](http://www.nightscout.info/wiki/welcome/set-up-nightscout-using-heroku), as Nightscout can reach the usage limits of the free Azure plan and cause it to shut down for hours or days. If you end up needing a paid tier, the $7/mo Heroku plan is also much cheaper than the first paid tier of Azure. Currently, the only added benefit to choosing the $7/mo Heroku plan vs the free Heroku plan is a section showing site use metrics for performance (such as response time). This has limited benefit to the average Nightscout user. In short, Heroku is the free and best option for Nightscout hosting.

- [Nightscout Setup with Heroku](http://www.nightscout.info/wiki/welcome/set-up-nightscout-using-heroku) (recommended)
- [Nightscout Setup with Microsoft Azure](http://www.nightscout.info/wiki/faqs-2/azure-2) (not recommended, please 
[switch from Azure to Heroku](http://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/While%20You%20Wait%20For%20Gear/nightscout-setup.html#switching-from-azure-to-heroku) )
- Linux based install (Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian) install with own Node.JS and MongoDB install (see software requirements below)
- Windows based install with own Node.JS and MongoDB install (see software requirements below)

## Minimum browser requirements for viewing the site:

- Android 4
- Chrome 68
- Edge 17
- Firefox 61
- Internet Explorer: not supported
- iOS 11
- Opera 54
- Safari 10 (macOS 10.12)

## Windows installation software requirements:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) Latest Node 8 LTS (Node 8.15.1 or later) or Node 10 LTS (Node 10.15.2 or later; Node 10.14.1 works for Azure). Node versions that do not have the latest security patches will not work. Use [Install instructions for Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) or use `setup.sh`)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community) 3.x or later. MongoDB 2.4 is only supported for Raspberry Pi.

As a non-root user clone this repo then install dependencies into the root of the project:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Installation notes for users with nginx or Apache reverse proxy for SSL/TLS offloading:

- Set `INSECURE_USE_HTTP` to `false`, to be able to use non secure HTTP connections to Nightscout server
- Your site redirects insecure connections to `https` by default. If you don't want that and use a Nginx or Apache proxy, set `INSECURE_USE_HTTP` to `true`. This will allow (unsafe) http traffic.
- In case you use a proxy. Do not use an external network interfaces for hosting Nightscout. Make sure the unsecure port is not available from a remote network connection
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers are enabled by default, use settings `SECURE_HSTS_HEADER` and `SECURE_HSTS_HEADER_*`
- See [Predefined values for your server settings](#predefined-values-for-your-server-settings-optional) for more details

## Installation notes for Microsoft Azure, Windows: 

- If deploying the software to Microsoft Azure, you must set ** in the app settings for *WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION* and *SCM_COMMAND_IDLE_TIMEOUT* **before** you deploy the latest Nightscout or the site deployment will likely fail. Other hosting environments do not require this setting. Please use:
```
WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION=10.14.1
SCM_COMMAND_IDLE_TIMEOUT=300
```
- See [install MongoDB, Node.js, and Nightscouton a single Windows system](https://github.com/jaylagorio/Nightscout-on-Windows-Server). if you want to host your Nightscout outside of the cloud. Although the instructions are intended for Windows Server the procedure is compatible with client versions of Windows such as Windows 7 and Windows 10.
- If you deploy to Windows and want to develop or test you need to install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) (use [setup-x86_64.exe](https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe) and make sure to install `build-essential` package. Test your configuration by executing `make` and check if all tests are ok. 

# Development

Wanna help with development, or just see how Nigthscout works? Great! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development related documentation.

# Usage

The data being uploaded from the server to the client is from a
MongoDB server such as [mongolab][mongodb].

[mongodb]: https://mongolab.com
[autoconfigure]: https://nightscout.github.io/pages/configure/
[mongostring]: https://nightscout.github.io/pages/mongostring/

## Updating my version?
The easiest way to update your version of cgm-remote-monitor to our latest
recommended version is to use the [update my fork tool][update-fork].  It even
gives out stars if you are up to date.

## What is my mongo string?

Try the [what is my mongo string tool][mongostring] to get a good idea of your
mongo string.  You can copy and paste the text in the gray box into your
`MONGO_CONNECTION` environment variable.

## Configure my uploader to match

Use the [autoconfigure tool][autoconfigure] to sync an uploader to your config.


## Nightscout API

The Nightscout API enables direct access to your DData without the need for direct Mongo access.
You can find CGM data in `/api/v1/entries`, Care Portal Treatments in `/api/v1/treatments`, and Treatment Profiles in `/api/v1/profile`.
The server status and settings are available from `/api/v1/status.json`.

By default the `/entries` and `/treatments` APIs limit results to the the most recent 10 values from the last 2 days.
You can get many more results, by using the `count`, `date`, `dateString`, and `created_at` parameters, depending on the type of data you're looking for.

#### Example Queries

(replace `http://localhost:1337` with your base url, YOUR-SITE)

  * 100's: `http://localhost:1337/api/v1/entries.json?find[sgv]=100`
  * Count of 100's in a month: `http://localhost:1337/api/v1/count/entries/where?find[dateString][$gte]=2016-09&find[dateString][$lte]=2016-10&find[sgv]=100`
  * BGs between 2 days: `http://localhost:1337/api/v1/entries/sgv.json?find[dateString][$gte]=2015-08-28&find[dateString][$lte]=2015-08-30`
  * Juice Box corrections in a year: `http://localhost:1337/api/v1/treatments.json?count=1000&find[carbs]=15&find[eventType]=Carb+Correction&find[created_at][$gte]=2015`
  * Boluses over 2U: `http://localhost:1337/api/v1/treatments.json?find[insulin][$gte]=2`

The API is Swagger enabled, so you can generate client code to make working with the API easy.
To learn more about the Nightscout API, visit https://YOUR-SITE.com/api-docs.html or review [swagger.yaml](swagger.yaml).


## Environment

`VARIABLE` (default) - description

### Required

  * `MONGO_CONNECTION` - Your mongo uri, for example: `mongodb://sally:sallypass@ds099999.mongolab.com:99999/nightscout`
  * `DISPLAY_UNITS` (`mg/dl`) - Choices: `mg/dl` and `mmol`.  Setting to `mmol` puts the entire server into `mmol` mode by default, no further settings needed.
  * `BASE_URL` - Used for building links to your sites api, ie pushover callbacks, usually the URL of your Nightscout site you may want https instead of http

### Features/Labs

  * `ENABLE` - Used to enable optional features, expects a space delimited list, such as: `careportal rawbg iob`, see [plugins](#plugins) below
  * `DISABLE` - Used to disable default features, expects a space delimited list, such as: `direction upbat`, see [plugins](#plugins) below
  * `API_SECRET` - A secret passphrase that must be at least 12 characters long, required to enable `POST` and `PUT`; also required for the Care Portal
  * `AUTH_DEFAULT_ROLES` (`readable`) - possible values `readable`, `denied`, or any valid role
    name.  When `readable`, anyone can view Nightscout without a token.
    Setting it to `denied` will require a token from every visit, using `status-only` will enable api-secret based login.
  * `IMPORT_CONFIG` - Used to import settings and extended settings from a url such as a gist.  Structure of file should be something like: `{"settings": {"theme": "colors"}, "extendedSettings": {"upbat": {"enableAlerts": true}}}`

  * `ALARM_TYPES` (`simple` if any `BG_`* ENV's are set, otherwise `predict`) - currently 2 alarm types are supported, and can be used independently or combined.  The `simple` alarm type only compares the current BG to `BG_` thresholds above, the `predict` alarm type uses highly tuned formula that forecasts where the BG is going based on it's trend.  `predict` **DOES NOT** currently use any of the `BG_`* ENV's
  * `BG_HIGH` (`260`) - must be set using mg/dl units; the high BG outside the target range that is considered urgent
  * `BG_TARGET_TOP` (`180`) - must be set using mg/dl units; the top of the target range, also used to draw the line on the chart
  * `BG_TARGET_BOTTOM` (`80`) - must be set using mg/dl units; the bottom of the target range, also used to draw the line on the chart
  * `BG_LOW` (`55`) - must be set using mg/dl units; the low BG outside the target range that is considered urgent

  ### Views

  There are a few alternate web views available that display a simplified BG stream. Append any of these to your Nightscout URL:
  * `/clock.html` - Shows current BG. Grey text on a black background.
  * `/bgclock.html` - Shows current BG, trend arrow, and time of day. Grey text on a black background.
  * `/clock-color.html` - Shows current BG and trend arrow. White text on a background that changes color to indicate current BG threshold (green = in range; blue = below range; yellow = above range; red = urgent below/above).

### Plugins

  Plugins are used extend the way information is displayed, how notifications are sent, alarms are triggered, and more.

  The built-in/example plugins that are available by default are listed below.  The plugins may still need to be enabled by adding to the `ENABLE` environment variable.

#### Default Plugins

  These can be disabled by setting the `DISABLE` env var, for example `DISABLE="direction upbat"`

##### `delta` (BG Delta)
  Calculates and displays the change between the last 2 BG values.

##### `direction` (BG Direction)
  Displays the trend direction.

##### `upbat` (Uploader Battery)
  Displays the most recent battery status from the uploader phone. . Use these [extended setting](#extended-settings) to adjust behavior:
  * `UPBAT_ENABLE_ALERTS` (`false`) - Set to `true` to enable uploader battery alarms via Pushover and IFTTT.
  * `UPBAT_WARN` (`30`) - Minimum battery percent to trigger warning.
  * `UPBAT_URGENT` (`20`) - Minimum battery percent to trigger urgent alarm.

##### `timeago` (Time Ago)
  Displays the time since last CGM entry. Use these [extended setting](#extended-settings) to adjust behavior:
  * `TIMEAGO_ENABLE_ALERTS` (`false`) - Set to `true` to enable stale data alarms via Pushover and IFTTT.
  * `ALARM_TIMEAGO_WARN` (`on`) - possible values `on` or `off`
  * `ALARM_TIMEAGO_WARN_MINS` (`15`) - minutes since the last reading to trigger a warning
  * `ALARM_TIMEAGO_URGENT` (`on`) - possible values `on` or `off`
  * `ALARM_TIMEAGO_URGENT_MINS` (`30`) - minutes since the last reading to trigger a urgent alarm


##### `devicestatus` (Device Status)
  Used by `upbat` and other plugins to display device status info.  Supports the `DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED="true"` [extended setting](#extended-settings) to send all device statuses to the client for retrospective use and to support other plugins.

##### `errorcodes` (CGM Error Codes)
  Generates alarms for CGM codes `9` (hourglass) and `10` (???).
  * Use [extended settings](#extended-settings) to adjust what errorcodes trigger notifications and alarms:
    * `ERRORCODES_INFO` (`1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8`) - By default the needs calibration (blood drop) and other codes below 9 generate an info level notification, set to a space separate list of number or `off` to disable
    * `ERRORCODES_WARN` (`off`) - By default there are no warning configured, set to a space separate list of numbers or `off` to disable
    * `ERRORCODES_URGENT` (`9 10`) - By default the hourglass and ??? generate an urgent alarm, set to a space separate list of numbers or `off` to disable

##### `ar2` (AR2 Forecasting)
  Generates alarms based on forecasted values. See [Forecasting using AR2 algorithm](https://github.com/nightscout/nightscout.github.io/wiki/Forecasting)
  * Enabled by default if no thresholds are set **OR** `ALARM_TYPES` includes `predict`.
  * Use [extended settings](#extended-settings) to adjust AR2 behavior:
    * `AR2_CONE_FACTOR` (`2`) - to adjust size of cone, use `0` for a single line.

##### `simplealarms` (Simple BG Alarms)
  Uses `BG_HIGH`, `BG_TARGET_TOP`, `BG_TARGET_BOTTOM`, `BG_LOW` thresholds to generate alarms.
  * Enabled by default if 1 of these thresholds is set **OR** `ALARM_TYPES` includes `simple`.

##### `profile` (Treatment Profile)
  Add link to Profile Editor and allow to enter treatment profile settings. Also uses the extended setting:
  * `PROFILE_HISTORY` (`off`) - possible values `on` or `off`. Enable/disable NS ability to keep history of your profiles (still experimental)
  * `PROFILE_MULTIPLE` (`off`) - possible values `on` or `off`. Enable/disable NS ability to handle and switch between multiple treatment profiles

#### Advanced Plugins:

##### `careportal` (Careportal)
  An optional form to enter treatments.

##### `boluscalc` (Bolus Wizard)

##### `food` (Custom Foods)
  An option plugin to enable adding foods from database in Bolus Wizard and enable .

##### `rawbg` (Raw BG)
  Calculates BG using sensor and calibration records from and displays an alternate BG values and noise levels. Defaults that can be adjusted with [extended setting](#extended-settings)
  * `DISPLAY` (`unsmoothed`) - Allows the user to control which algorithm is used to calculate the displayed raw BG values using the most recent calibration record.
    * `unfiltered` - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's unfiltered value.
    * `filtered` - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's filtered value. The glucose record's filtered values are generally produced by the CGM by a running average of the unfiltered values to produce a smoothed value when the sensor noise is high.
    * `unsmoothed` - Raw BG is calculated by first finding the ratio of the calculated filtered value (the same value calculated by the `filtered` setting) to the reported glucose value. The displayed raw BG value is calculated by dividing the calculated unfiltered value (the same value calculated by the `unfiltered` setting) by the ratio.  The effect is to exagerate changes in trend direction so the trend changes are more noticeable to the user. This is the legacy raw BG calculation algorithm.

##### `iob` (Insulin-on-Board)
  Adds the IOB pill visualization in the client and calculates values that used by other plugins.  Uses treatments with insulin doses and the `dia` and `sens` fields from the [treatment profile](#treatment-profile).

##### `cob` (Carbs-on-Board)
  Adds the COB pill visualization in the client and calculates values that used by other plugins.  Uses treatments with carb doses and the `carbs_hr`, `carbratio`, and `sens` fields from the [treatment profile](#treatment-profile).

##### `bwp` (Bolus Wizard Preview)

  * `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` (`*`) - The list of sites that are allow to make requests

#### Extended Settings
  Some plugins support additional configuration using extra environment variables.  These are prefixed with the name of the plugin and a `_`.  For example setting `MYPLUGIN_EXAMPLE_VALUE=1234` would make `extendedSettings.exampleValue` available to the `MYPLUGIN` plugin.

  Plugins only have access to their own extended settings, all the extended settings of client plugins will be sent to the browser.

  * `DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED` (`true`) - Defaults to true. Users who only have a single device uploading data to Nightscout can set this to false to reduce the data use of the site.

#### Pushover
  In addition to the normal web based alarms, there is also support for [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) based alarms and notifications.

  To get started install the Pushover application on your iOS or Android device and create an account.

  Using that account login to [Pushover](https://pushover.net/), in the top left you’ll see your User Key, you’ll need this plus an application API Token/Key to complete this setup.

  You’ll need to [Create a Pushover Application](https://pushover.net/apps/build).  You only need to set the Application name, you can ignore all the other settings, but setting an Icon is a nice touch.  Maybe you'd like to use [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor/master/static/images/large.png)?

  Pushover is configured using the following Environment Variables:

    * `ENABLE` - `pushover` should be added to the list of plugin, for example: `ENABLE="pushover"`.
    * `PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN` - Used to enable pushover notifications, this token is specific to the application you create from in [Pushover](https://pushover.net/), ***[additional pushover information](#pushover)*** below.
    * `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY` - Your Pushover user key, can be found in the top left of the [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) site, this can also be a pushover delivery group key to send to a group rather than just a single user.  This also supports a space delimited list of keys.  To disable `INFO` level pushes set this to `off`.
    * `PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY` - An optional Pushover user/group key, will be used for system wide alarms (level > `WARN`).  If not defined this will fallback to `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY`.  A possible use for this is sending important messages and alarms to a CWD that you don't want to send all notification too.  This also support a space delimited list of keys.  To disable Alarm pushes set this to `off`.
    * `PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY` - An optional Pushover user/group key, will be used for system wide user generated announcements.  If not defined this will fallback to `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY` or `PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY`.  This also support a space delimited list of keys. To disable Announcement pushes set this to `off`.
    * `BASE_URL` - Used for pushover callbacks, usually the URL of your Nightscout site, use https when possible.
    * `API_SECRET` - Used for signing the pushover callback request for acknowledgments.
    
    If you never want to get info level notifications (treatments) use `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY="off"`
    If you never want to get an alarm via pushover use `PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY="off"`
    If you never want to get an announcement via pushover use `PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY="off"`
    
    If only `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY` is set it will be used for all info notifications, alarms, and announcements
    
    For testing/development try [localtunnel](http://localtunnel.me/).

#### IFTTT Maker
 In addition to the normal web based alarms, and pushover, there is also integration for [IFTTT Webhooks](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks).

 With Maker you are able to integrate with all the other [IFTTT Services](https://ifttt.com/services).  For example you can send a tweet when there is an alarm, change the color of hue light, send an email, send and sms, and so much more.

 1. Setup IFTTT account: [login](https://ifttt.com/login) or [create an account](https://ifttt.com/join)
 2. Follow the  [Detailed IFTTT setup Instructions](docs/plugins/maker-setup.md)
 3. Configure Nightscout by setting these webpage environment variables:
  * `ENABLE` - `maker` should be added to the list of plugins, for example: `ENABLE="maker"`.
  * `MAKER_KEY` - Set this to your secret key (see  [[Detailed Instructions](docs/plugins/maker-setup.md) ) `MAKER_KEY="abcMyExampleabc123defjt1DeNSiftttmak-XQb69p"` This also supports a space delimited list of keys.
  * `MAKER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY` - An optional Maker key, will be used for system wide user generated announcements.  If not defined this will fallback to `MAKER_KEY`.  A possible use for this is sending important messages and alarms to another device that you don't want to send all notification too.  This also support a space delimited list of keys.

 Plugins can create custom events, but all events sent to IFTTT webhooks will be prefixed with `ns-`.  The core events are:
  * `ns-event` - This event is sent to the maker service for all alarms and notifications.  This is good catch all event for general logging.
  * `ns-allclear` - This event is sent to the maker service when an alarm has been ack'd or when the server starts up without triggering any alarms.  For example, you could use this event to turn a light to green.
  * `ns-info` - Plugins that generate notifications at the info level will cause this event to also be triggered.  It will be sent in addition to `ns-event`.
  * `ns-warning` - Alarms at the warning level with cause this event to also be triggered.  It will be sent in addition to `ns-event`.
  * `ns-urgent` - Alarms at the urgent level with cause this event to also be triggered.  It will be sent in addition to `ns-event`.
  * see the [full list of events](lib/plugins/maker-setup.md#events)


### Treatment Profile
  Some of the [plugins](#plugins) make use of a treatment profile that can be edited using the Profile Editor, see the link in the Settings drawer on your site.

  Treatment Profile Fields:

  * `timezone` (Time Zone) - time zone local to the patient. *Should be set.*
  * `units` (Profile Units) - blood glucose units used in the profile, either "mgdl" or "mmol"
  * `dia` (Insulin duration) - value should be the duration of insulin action to use in calculating how much insulin is left active. Defaults to 3 hours.
  * `carbs_hr` (Carbs per Hour) - The number of carbs that are processed per hour, for more information see [#DIYPS](http://diyps.org/2014/05/29/determining-your-carbohydrate-absorption-rate-diyps-lessons-learned/).
  * `carbratio` (Carb Ratio) - grams per unit of insulin.
  * `sens` (Insulin sensitivity) How much one unit of insulin will normally lower blood glucose.
  * `basal` The basal rate set on the pump.
  * `target_high` - Upper target for correction boluses.
  * `target_low` - Lower target for correction boluses.

  Some example profiles are [here](example-profiles.md).

## Setting environment variables
Easy to emulate on the commandline:

```bash
    echo 'MONGO_CONNECTION=mongodb://sally:sallypass@ds099999.mongolab.com:99999/nightscout' >> my.env
    echo 'MONGO_COLLECTION=entries' >> my.env
```

From now on you can run using
```bash
    $ (eval $(cat my.env | sed 's/^/export /') && PORT=1337 node server.js)
```

Your hosting provider probably has a way to set these through their GUI.

### Vagrant install

Optionally, use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) with the
included `Vagrantfile` and `setup.sh` to install OS and node packages to
a virtual machine.

```bash
host$ vagrant up
host$ vagrant ssh
vm$ setup.sh
```

The setup script will install OS packages then run `npm install`.

The Vagrant VM serves to your host machine only on 192.168.33.10, you can access
the web interface on [http://192.168.33.10:1337](http://192.168.33.10:1337)
